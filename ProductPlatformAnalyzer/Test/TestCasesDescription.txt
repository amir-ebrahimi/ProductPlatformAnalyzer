Test cases for the loading of the program:

	Starting with 0: They cover cases of NOT enough data to load correctly (e.g. One of Variant, Variant Group, Operation Is missing)
	Strating with 1: They cover cases of ENOUGH data to load correctly (e.g. All Variant, Variant Group, and Operation is present)
